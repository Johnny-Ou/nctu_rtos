# Lab 1 for uC/OS-II: Periodic Task Emulation

## Objectives
- To implement periodic tasks
- To observe the scheduling behaviors
  - Fixed priority scheduling

## Task Sets
- Two sets of periodic tasks
  - Task set 1 = { t1(1,3), t2(3,6) }
  - Task set 2 = { t1(1,3), t2(3,6), t3(4,9) }
  - Tasks all arrive at the same time
  - Show context switch behaviors
  - Show deadline violations if there is any
